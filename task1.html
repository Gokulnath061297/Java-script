<!-- // SECTION A: Technical Questions
// 1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

//   var - It allows declaration,initialization,reuse,reinitialization,redeclaration
//   let - It allows declaration,initialization and reuse,reinitialization and does not allow redeclaration.
//   const - It allows declararion ,initialization and does not allow reuse,reinitialization,redeclaration.

// 2. Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?

//    var keyword allows redeclaration because it is function-scoped and hoisted, therefore multiple declarations are treated as a single variable.

// 3. Which keyword allows reinitialization?
    
//     var and let allows reinitialization

// 4. Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?

//    const keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization


// 5. Why should const be used for fixed values?

//    Because const cant be reused,reinitialized or redeclared

// 6. What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?

//    It shows SyntaxError because let does not allow redeclaration .
     
// 7. What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?

//    Type error occurs when reassigning a const varialbe.

// 8. Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?

//    In modern JavaScript, const is preferred because it provides block scope and prevents reuse,reinitialization,redeclaration.
//    let is preferred when reuse and redeclaration are needed.  

// 9. Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.

//   No const be declared without initialization because it represents a constant reference that cannot be reassigned later. Declaring it without a value causes a SyntaxError.

// 10. When should var be avoided?
 
//     It is function-scoped, allows reuse,reinitialization,redeclaration to avoid all this we must avoid using var.

// 11. Predict the output: -->
<script>
{
var a = 10;
a = 20;
var a = 30;
console.log(a);
}
// Output: 30
</script>
<!-- // 12. Predict the output: -->
<script>

let b = 5;
    b = 15;
console.log(b);

Output:15
</script>
<!-- // 13. Identify the error: -->
 <!-- <script>
let x = 10;
let x = 20;
</script> -->
<!-- Answer : let x = 10;
             x = 20;

Reason: Let can be redeclared -->

<!-- 14. Identify the error: -->
<!-- const y = 50;
y = 100;

Answer: const y = 50;

Reason: const can't be reused,reinitialize or redeclared after initialization. -->

<!-- 15. Write a program using var to show redeclaration.

Answer: var a = 20;
        console.log("Before redeclaration:", a);

        var a = 30;
        console.log("After redeclaration:", a);

16. Write a program using let to show reinitialization.

Answer: let b = 10;
        console.log("Before reinitialization:", b);
            b = 20;
        console.log("After reinitialization:", b);

17. Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.

Answer: const c = 50;
 
   Const allows declararion ,initialization and does not allow reuse,reinitialization,redeclaration.


18. Convert var to let where applicable.

   Answer: var num = 10;
               num = 20;
           console.log(num);

           let num = 10;
               num = 20;
           console.log(num);


19. Convert var to const where applicable.

   Answer: var PI = 3.14;
           console.log(PI);

           const PI = 3.14;
           console.log(PI);
 
           Use const by default, switch to let only if reassignment is required.

20. Write your own example for var, let, and const.   

   Answer: var a = 10; 
           let b = 20; 
           const c = 30; 
           a = 15; 
           b = 25;
           var a = 35; -->
